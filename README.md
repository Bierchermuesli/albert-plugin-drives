# Drives

Albert plugin to mount, unmount and safely remove drives, e.g. USB sticks, external disks or optical media.

- Lists the drives that are not part of the system, with their state (mounted, not mounted, locked).
- Mount and open, unmount, copy the mount path. Shows the free space of mounted drives.
- Force unmount (lazy) for busy drives. If unmounting fails because the drive is busy, the error names the programs using it.
- Encrypted (LUKS) volumes: unlock with a passphrase and mount, lock.
- Safely remove: unmounts and locks all volumes of the drive, then powers it off or ejects the medium.

Search by name, label, drive model or device, or use the trigger `mount `.

## Platforms

Linux using UDisks2, independent of the desktop environment. Permissions are handled by polkit, in an active session usually without a password.

The platform specific part is a small backend interface (`src/backend.h`), so other platforms, e.g. macOS using DiskArbitration, can be added.

## Build

The plugin is built as part of the Albert source tree. Clone it into `plugins/drives` and build Albert as usual. Requires Qt DBus and Widgets.
